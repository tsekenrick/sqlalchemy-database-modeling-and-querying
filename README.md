# Scoot Share - Database Design and Querying with SQLAlchemy

This assignment is a continuation of [this one](https://github.com/tsekenrick/database-design-and-normalization). I created a SQL database
using the SQLAlchemy ORM, and then loaded some mock data into the database and then made some basic queries. The database model was based
on the design proposed in the aforementioned assignment..
